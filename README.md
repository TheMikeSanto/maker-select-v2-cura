# Cura 15.04 PLA profile for the Monoprice Maker Select V2 3D printer
If you are like me and can't use the version of Cura included with the Maker Select because you use a Mac, or if you simply don't have the contents of the included SD card, you can use the profile included in this repo. Simply import `maker_select_v2_cura_1504.profile.ini` into [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org), or any other slicer that accepts Cura `ini` files, and you should be ready to print.
